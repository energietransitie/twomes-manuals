Frequently asked information about the Enelogic online data souce.

## 1. What information does the research server collect from this online data source?

[Enelogic](https://enelogic.com/) is a website that allows you to read your smart meter remotely. Enelogic is certified as an [Other Services Provider (ODA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Services_Provider). Through the NeedForHeat app, you can give Enelogic permission to fetch the following gas and electricity meter readings from your smart meter every day:

- Interval readings up to 10 days ago:
  - Gas: every hour
  - Electricity: every 15 minutes
- Daily readings up to 40 days ago
- Monthly readings up to 13 months ago

## 2. How can I check if the data collection is working properly?

Look in the NeedForHeat app under the 'Smart meter via Enelogic' data source. If this is within the last 2 days (48 hours), everything is functioning correctly. You'll notice this immediately if you've just added Enelogic to the app. Once you've linked your smart meter to your Enelogic account, it usually takes 1.5 days for Enelogic to receive data for the first time. After that, the research server retrieves new data from your Enelogic account once a day.
