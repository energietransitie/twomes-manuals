In the NeedForHeat study and throughout the entire research project [REDUCEDHEATCARB](https://edu.nl/gutuc), we handle your data carefully. You can participate in an online survey where we may request personal information such as your home and email address. This allows us to look up information about your residence and invite you to participate in the measurement study. During the measurement study, devices at your home will record data such as indoor temperature and send it to our research database along with a unique code for your residence. After your enrollment in the study, Remeha will securely transmit monitoring data received from your heating system during the measurement period to us for research purposes, along with a unique code for your residence.

Important: Outside of the research, it is not possible for others to identify the source of the data. Only Remeha, Windesheim, and Enelogic are aware of the connection between measurements and residences. The information published in reports and scientific publications does not reveal specific residences or individuals. Note: even after publication, Remeha and/or Enelogic may potentially trace the data back to your residence. If you wish to prevent this, you can request Remeha and/or Enelogic to delete the collected data after the completion of data collection.

The research has been [approved by the Ethical Research Committee of Windesheim](../assets/231121-goedkeurende-verklaring-ECO-Windesheim-REDUCEDHEATCARB.pdf). For more information, you can also refer to the [summary](../../privacy-summary/) and [full privacy policy](../../privacy-full/).
