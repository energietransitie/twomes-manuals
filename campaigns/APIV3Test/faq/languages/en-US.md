### 1. Which data sources do I need to connect?

All participants will receive two measurement devices. Open the NeedForHeat app, scan the QR code on the measurement device from the app, and you will automatically see the information below and the app will also help you connect it to your Wi-Fi network at home:

- [Smart Meter Module: Installation](../../../../devices/twomes-p1-reader-firmware/installation/)
- [Living Room Module: Installation](../../../../devices/twomes-co2-occupancy-scd41-m5coreink-firmware/installation/)

In addition, you are asked to connect one online data source:

- [Enelogic: Installation](../../../../devices/enelogic/installation/)

### 2. How do I re-connect a measurement device?

Reconnecting a measurement device to your Wi-Fi network may be necessary, for example, if you get a new Wi-Fi router or if the initial connection was unsuccessful. The process for re-connecting varies for each device. Click on the question mark next to the device name in the list on the NeedForHeat app screen, or scan the QR code on the device above `Info? Scan!`.

You can also find this information in the frequently asked questions for the monitoring device you want to re-connect

### 3. What do the circles next to my devices indicate?
These circles serve as a means to monitor the uploads of each device. Below is a brief explanation of each circle's significance and the corresponding actions you may need to take:

#### 3.1. Status Green - Everything is normal
The DataSource is uploading as expected with no issues, indicated by the green circle and icon. \
The circle also displays the countdown to the next upload, showing hours and minutes.

#### 3.2. Status Orange/Yellow - Uploads are delayed
If the last upload from the DataSource is delayed, the circle and icon turns orange/yellow, signaling a "Late" status. \
While this may not warrant immediate concern, you may attempt to reset the DataSource to fix the delay.
