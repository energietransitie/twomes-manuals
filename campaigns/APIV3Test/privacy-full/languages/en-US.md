## Introduction

The NeedForHeat app is exclusively for participating as a test subject in the research project [REDUCEDHEATCARB](https://edu.nl/gutuc) by Windesheim University. To participate, you must have signed up and received an invitation. The invitation includes an Account Activation Token, embedded in a clickable link and/or QR code on your smartphone. Clicking the link or scanning the QR code installs the NeedForHeat app and links it to an account on the research server.

Through the NeedForHeat app and associated service(s) and/or website(s) hosted under the domain energietransitiewindesheim.nl, data is processed for scientific research, including potential personal data. Our processing adheres to the requirements of the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/themas/basis-avg/avg-algemeen). Windesheim University is responsible for this data processing.

## Purpose of the Research

The research aims to determine the necessary measurement data, frequency, and precision regarding your home, heating system, energy usage, and heating behavior. This information is crucial to adequately understand the key features of a home, heating system, and heating behavior. The goal is to provide advice for the heat transition that better suits specific homes, installations, and heating behaviors.

## Data Usage

By using our app, service, and/or website, you provide us with certain data, including potential personal data. Windesheim considers careful handling of your data essential. Your data is processed and secured with the utmost care.

We store and use only the data provided by you or clearly indicated to be processed by us.

As explained below, we achieve this by keeping your Direct Identifying Data separate from Other Data you provide (including via the NeedForHeat app). Your Pseudonym acts as the link between your Direct Identifying Data and Other Data.

## Data Obtained during Recruitment and Enrollment

In collaboration with BDR Thermea, we recruit participants for the research through its subsidiary, Remeha. This involves, among other methods, an online survey. Through the survey, you grant consent for the research, allowing Remeha to transmit data received from your boiler and/or thermostat to Windesheim for research purposes.

During recruitment and enrollment, you provide Direct Identifying Data: personal data directly traceable to you as a natural person and/or to your household, such as name, address, city, and email. We link this Direct Identifying Data to a Pseudonym (a unique code).

You may also provide Other Data during recruitment and enrollment (e.g., via an online survey or through Remeha), such as information about your home and heating system. These data are not Direct Identifying Data and cannot be directly traced back to you as a natural person and/or household. Throughout the research, these data are linked to your Pseudonym. We only use the option to trace data if and for as long as necessary to conduct the research properly. For example, to answer a question from you to the research helpdesk or to contact you if no measurement data have been received from your home for more than 24 hours.

## Data Provided to Us via Remeha

During recruitment and enrollment for this research, you can grant Remeha permission to share data about your heating system with us for research purposes. This includes:

- Data about the type of boiler and thermostat you use.
- Time-series data during the measurement period with approximately one value per second:
  - Indoor temperature.
  - Outdoor temperature.
  - Heating setpoint temperature.
  - Intensity of gas consumption by the boiler.
  - Whether the boiler is firing for space heating or hot tap water.
  - Temperature of water going to and coming back from the radiators.
  - Flow rate of water for heating.
  - Setpoint temperature for hot tap water.
  - Temperature of hot tap water.
  - Flow rate of hot tap water.
  - Gas consumption by the boiler for heating.
  - Gas consumption by the boiler for hot tap water.
- Initial values at the beginning of the measurement period and changes during the measurement period:
  - Thermostat program.
  - Setting of maximum supply temperature and maximum power for heating and hot tap water.

## Directly Provided Data via the NeedForHeat App

Windesheim processes data that you provide when downloading and installing the NeedForHeat app.

The NeedForHeat app is downloaded through a third-party app store, such as Apple and Google. We have no control over what personal data the provider processes and for what purpose. We recommend reading the relevant privacy statements of the respective provider.

If invited to participate in the research, you will receive an Account Activation Token via email, a unique code for one-time use linked to your Pseudonym. This is used to link the NeedForHeat app to your Pseudonym. Other Data you subsequently provide via the NeedForHeat app can also be linked to your Pseudonym. This may include the following types of data and data sources:

1. Measurement data continuously and automatically received from certain measurement devices you install or have installed in your home and link to your NeedForHeat app. Each device's measurements will be displayed.
2. Measurement data continuously and automatically received about you from certain data sources. You can grant us access to this by logging into the data source in the NeedForHeat app and giving permission to transfer specific data to NeedForHeat. For a data source requiring login via the app, we explicitly do not receive your username and password for that data source.

## Automatically Collected Data via Authorized Data Sources

We also receive automatically collected data from one or more data sources after you have completed the necessary steps as described above. Examples include:

- *Smart Meter Monitor*
  - Gas: meter readings every 10 minutes for modern smart meters (DSMR5 or newer) and every hour for older smart meters.
  - Electricity: 4 meter readings every 10 minutes: delivered at peak rate, delivered at off-peak rate, returned at peak rate, returned at off-peak rate.
- *Smart Meter Data via an Other Services Provider (ODA)*
  - The same data as the *Smart Meter Monitor*, but meter readings with intervals no smaller than 15 minutes for electricity and no smaller than 1 hour for gas.
  - Meter readings from the recent past: up to 13 monthly readings, 40 daily readings, and 10 days of interval data.
- *CO<sub>2</sub> Monitor with Presence Monitor*
  - CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, temperature, and relative humidity in the room where the device is placed (every 10 minutes).
  - For each of you and your housemates: the number of smartphones that (automatically) respond to a presence request. At the beginning of the measurement period, we ask you to register your smartphone to be counted in the presence registration. We also ask your housemates to do the same. After that, the device will count every 10 minutes how many (smartphones of) registered persons are at home. By counting the number of people (exhaling CO<sub>2</sub>), the device estimates whether there is someone at home. This provides us with more insight into the ventilation and heat loss from the home. However, we do not record when which person is at home; we only see the total number of people present.
- *Room Temperature*
  - Temperature in the room where the device is placed (every 10 minutes). We use this to detect a deviation from the average indoor temperature. This helps, among other things, to detect malfunctioning heating systems.

The automatically collected data helps us in various ways. For example, to check the correctness of your registration of your home characteristics and the setpoints of your heating system, to determine the average indoor temperature and, by deduction, the outdoor temperature, to calculate the heat loss of your home, and to compare the results obtained from the analysis of the automatically collected data with your manually provided data (using the NeedForHeat app and via online surveys) to identify possible errors or fraud.

## Third-Party Services We Use to Process Your Data

To process data you provide via online surveys, the NeedForHeat app, service, and/or website, we use services from:

- *Qualtrics LLC, located in Provo, UT, USA*, for processing data from online surveys.
- *Strato AG, located in Berlin, Germany*, for receiving, storing, and analyzing Other Data we receive from you.
- *SURF B.V., located in Utrecht*, for storing (backups of) Other Data we receive from you.
- *Google LLC, located in Mountain View, CA, USA*, for processing data required for Firebase Dynamic Links, including your Account Activation Code and information about the NeedForHeat app in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
- *Rentalsplit B.V., located in Barendrecht*, for automatically reading, storing, and transmitting interval readings from your smart meter, including historical data, through their ODA service Enelogic.
- *Microsoft, located in Redmond, WA, USA*, for processing data via Office 365 services, including potentially analyzing measurement data.

Data processing by each of the above-mentioned parties is subject to an agreement with the respective party that complies with the conditions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Data Exchange with Third Parties

If you have indicated through the online survey that Remeha may transmit data from your heating system, we send your consent (along with your name, address, city, email, and pseudonym) through a secure channel to BDR Thermea and its subsidiary Rehema. This allows them, for the purpose of the research, to:

- Upload pseudonymized data that Remeha receives from your boiler and/or thermostat during the measurement study.
- Refer test subjects who contact the Remeha helpdesk with questions about the research to the research helpdesk.

For this purpose, we have entered into a data exchange agreement with BDR Thermea.

## Security

We take security measures to limit misuse and unauthorized access to personal data. In particular, we take the following measures:

- Access to personal data is shielded.
- Our app and servers use modern security methods and techniques, such as TLS/SSL-secured connections to certificate-authenticated servers in the energietransitiewindesheim.nl domain. This ensures that all information between you, your smartphone, the measurement devices, your online data sources, and our website and services is secured, and you can be sure that this data only goes to us and our servers.
- Direct Identifying Data, such as name, address, city, and email, is stored separately from Other Data.
- Access to Direct Identifying Data is strictly limited to only the research helpdesk (at Windesheim and the Remeha helpdesk) and a few researchers.
- Other researchers involved in the research project only use your Other Data for their analyses; they do not have access to Direct Identifying Data.
- No later than five years after the end of the research project, but in any case before we publish anonymized data as open data, we remove the link between your Pseudonym and your direct identifying data.

## Open Data

After your Pseudonym is decoupled, we can publish your Other Data as open data. This means that we make available Other Data collected in the research on one or more public websites where datasets for research are published, such as GitHub (for example, as done with [this dataset](https://github.com/ictinnovaties-zorg/dataset-diabetes-adolescents-time-series-with-heart-rate)) and/or [DANS by KNAW](https://dans.knaw.nl/en). This allows your data to contribute to further research that benefits the energy transition.

Before Other Data is made public, Windesheim ensures that these data are not directly traceable to specific homes or individuals. However, Remeha and/or Enelogic have data that they could compare as a kind of 'energy fingerprint' with the publicly available open data, potentially allowing them to still link this data to specific homes or individuals. For others, the publicly published data will not be directly traceable to specific homes or individuals.

After we have indicated that data collection for the research is completed, a waiting period will be imposed before the data is published as open data. During this period, as a test subject, you have the opportunity to request Remeha and/or Enelogic to specifically delete the 'energy fingerprint' data they have collected during the research. This waiting period allows you, as a test subject, to ensure that your data is deleted by the relevant party(ies) before the raw research data is made public. We aim to make this waiting period sufficiently generous to provide you as a test subject with the necessary certainty while also considering the purpose of publishing the data and any processing procedures.

## Third-Party Hardware, Software Systems, and Websites

This statement does not apply to the third-party hardware and software systems directly or indirectly connected to the NeedForHeat app and service, nor does it apply to third-party websites connected to the NeedForHeat app and service through links. We cannot guarantee that these third parties handle your personal data in a reliable or secure manner. We recommend reading the privacy statement of these services before using them.

## Access, Modification, and Restriction of Processing of Your Data

You can use NeedForHeat only as part of scientific research. Therefore, according to [Article 44 of the Implementation Act General Data Protection Regulation](https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0040940&hoofdstuk=4&artikel=44&z=2019-02-19&g=2019-02-19), you may not have the right to access, rectify, and restrict the processing of your data by Windesheim in this research. However, you always have the right to stop your participation in this research, even without giving reasons. This means that no new data about you will be collected for this research.
