You will soon be asked to provide the location of your home so the app can assign your residence to one of approximately 20 hexagonal weather zones in the Netherlands. This weather zone is used to accurately calculate the weather at your location using data from nearby KNMI weather stations.

Here are the three steps to complete this:

1. *Place the marker on your house on the map:* Move and zoom in on the map until the marker is on your house. You can also press the GPS button to go directly to your current location, which is usually your home.
2. *Confirm your weather zone:* A hexagonal zone containing your house will be displayed. Confirm if this is correct.
3. *Send the weather zone:* The weather zone will be sent to the server. Your exact location will not be sent; only the weather zone is sent to ensure privacy.
