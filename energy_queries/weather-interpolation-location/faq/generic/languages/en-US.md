# Where do you live? (Weather zones) - FAQ
Frequently asked information about the WeatherInterpolationLocation EnergyQuery.

## 1. What is this query used for?
This query is used to place users in weather zones and only send that weather zone to the server so we can obtain weather data for their area. By only using zones, we ensure that we do not store the user's home location in our backend.

## 2. Monitoring
After the EnergyQuery is sent, you don't need to do anything further. You can view the sent Weather Zone by clicking on the "Where do you live? (regarding weather zones)" EnergyQuery in the resources list.

## 3. What if I have other questions or comments?
Then, please send an email to the helpdesk of the NeedForHeat research at [needforheatresearch@windesheim.nl](needforheatresearch@windesheim.nl).
