# Home Location (Weather Zone) - FAQ

Frequently asked questions.

## 1. Why am I being asked this?
This question asks you to provide your home location so the app can assign your residence to one of the hexagonal weather zones. This helps accurately calculate the weather at your location using data from nearby KNMI weather stations. Your exact location will not be sent to the server; only the weather zone is sent to ensure privacy.

## 2. Monitoring

After answering the question, you don't need to do anything further. There is no monitoring as with other data sources; the question simply appears in the list as activated. 
## 3. Can I change my answer?
You cannot change a submitted answer. If you need to do so, see point 4.

## 4. What if I have other questions or comments?
