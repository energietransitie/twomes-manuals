# Home Location (Weather Zone) - FAQ

Frequently asked questions.

## 1. Why do I get this question?
The app uses the location of your home to assign it to one of approximately 20 hexagonal weather zones in the Netherlands. This helps to accurately calculate the weather at your location using data from nearby KNMI weather stations. Your exact home location is not sent to the server; only the weather zone is sent to ensure privacy.

## 2. Can I change my answer?
You cannot change a submitted answer. If you need to do so, see point 3.
