# Building Energy Profile - FAQ
Frequently asked information about the Building Energy Profile EnergyQuery.

## 1. What is this query used for?
This query aims to ask the user for their home address so the app can fetch important data and calculate key metrics like efficiency and energy loss. Your address will not be part of the data sent to the server. Only the calculated data will be sent due to privacy reasons.

## 2. Monitoring
After the EnergyQuery is sent, you don't need to do anything further. There is no monitoring like other DataSources, it will just appear in the list as "Finished."

## 3. What if I have other questions or comments?
Then, please send an email to the helpdesk of the NeedForHeat research at [needforheatresearch@windesheim.nl](needforheatresearch@windesheim.nl).
