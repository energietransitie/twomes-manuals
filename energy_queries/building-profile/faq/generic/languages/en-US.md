# Home Address (Energy Profile) - FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions.

## 1. Why am I asked for this information?
This question asks you to provide your residential address so the app can download data about your home from public registers. This data is used to estimate various energy-related characteristics of your home and installation. Your address is not sent to the server for privacy reasons; only the calculated data is transmitted.

## 2. Monitoring
After answering the question, you don't need to do anything further. There is no monitoring as with other data sources; the question simply appears in the list as activated. 

## 3. Can I change my answer?
Once you've submitted an answer, you can't modify it. If necessary, refer to point 4 for further assistance.

## 4. What if I have other questions or comments?
