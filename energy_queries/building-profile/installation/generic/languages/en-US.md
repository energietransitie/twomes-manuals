# Home Address (Energy Profile)

You'll be asked to provide your residential address so the app can download data about your home from public registers like [Kadaster](https://www.kadaster.nl/) and [3D-BAG](https://3dbag.nl/). This data is used to estimate various energy-related characteristics of your home and installation, based solely on information from these registers.

In the research, we compare these estimates with data derived from several weeks of measurements.

Here are the two steps to complete this:

1. *Place the marker on your house on the map:* Drag and zoom in on the map until the marker is on your house. You can also press the GPS button to go directly to your current location, usually your home. The address associated with this location will be displayed, and you can edit it before confirming.
2. *Send the calculated data:* The app retrieves important data and performs calculations based on the provided address. Your address is not sent for privacy reasons; only the calculated data is transmitted.
