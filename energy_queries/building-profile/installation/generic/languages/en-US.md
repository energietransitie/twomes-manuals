# About the "Building Energy Profile" EnergyQuery

This specific EnergyQuery, called "Building Energy Profile", aims to ask the user for their home address so the app can fetch important data and calculate key metrics like efficiency and energy loss. This query involves two steps to complete.

There is no monitoring for this query.

## What is an EnergyQuery?

An EnergyQuery is essentially a questionnaire that assists users in providing relevant information. It asks specific questions to collect data necessary for a particular research or process. In this case, the EnergyQuery is used to fetch information about the user's building/home, including aspects like energy loss.

# Manual

## Step 1: Placing the Marker and Getting the Address

You are asked to move the map to place a marker, which will be positioned in the middle of the screen, on top of YOUR home. You can also press the GPS button to go straight to your current location, which is likely to be your home.

In a text field, your address should be displayed. If this is not the correct address, you can edit it before sending it over.

Please note that the format of the address should be like this: \
*(Street) (House number + any additional identifiers), (Postal code) (City), (Country)*

An example address is: \
"Dorpsstraat 123A bis, 1234 AB Utrecht"

## Step 2: Fetching Data, Calculating, and Sending

In the second step, using the provided address, the NeedForHeat app proceeds to fetch important data and starts calculating based on formulas the EnergyDoctor has set. When everything is finished, the calculated data will be sent over to the server so the EnergyDoctor can analyze it.

Note that your address will not be part of the data sent to the server. Only the calculated data will be sent due to privacy reasons.
